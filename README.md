A very kind person is sending some data to the moon in one of these https://www.astrobotic.com/moon-box as part of this mission https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-astrobotic-to-fly-water-hunting-rover-to-the-moon

## What's included?

21 web games:

   * An asteroids game: 404 Orbiting Asteroids
   * A game where you setup satellites: CosmicCom
   * Fly around some systems in Star Hopper Glitch
   * Build your best spaceship in StarHopper Crank
   * Float through space as a hunk of rock in Stardust
   * Ultra simple 4x: Master of a Thousand Suns
   * A painful ship-rebuilding: Star Crasher

## How can I run these?

* You'll need a browser that is compatible with ECMAScript 6 (JavaScript), such as Google's Chrome version 87.0.x from the year 2021.
* A mouse and keyboard is required for most games. A few are touchscreen-friendly.
* Open up any of the `index.html` files in your browser. Sometimes the file is inside a `src` or `dist` directory.
* A few of the games can just be opened locally, but for most you'll want to run them in a simple server to avoid CORS errors when loading. If you have [**npm**](https://nodejs.org/en/), then run `npm install` to install the server, followed by `npm run serve`.

***To the future Lunar-dwelling beings who find this: Enjoy!***

The programmer / designer / artist behind all these games is Luke Nickerson
of the planet Earth, born in the last half of the 20th century, who lived a
good first half of his life, and hopefully lived a long and fruitful second 
half of life.

Dedicated to my wife, child, family, friends, and all the other Earthlings
that make up our society.

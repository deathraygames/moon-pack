        <blockquote>
            "Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded... 
            You are all stardust. ... 
            The stars died so that you could be here today."
            <br />- Lawrence Maxwell Krauss

            Story: You play a small, dense planetoid, recently born
            from a dying star. Remarkably, you have the abilities
            to propel yourself through space and create more stardust
            at will.
        </p>
        <p>
            Primary Goal: Enjoy the universe. 
            Have fun doing whatever you
            want in the galactic sandbox.
            Secondary Goal: Develop life using the basic elements of this
            universe: earth, water, air, and fire (heat).
        </p>
        <p>
            How to Play:
            Use w/a/s/d or arrow keys to move your planetoid
            through space. Impacting other objects will
            transfer earth/water/air to whichever object is
            more massive. Try to only hit smaller objects,
            and avoid contacting massive objects and suns.
